This folder collect PCB files (PNG, SVG, Fritzing), Arduino's sketches and libraries.

In addition there will be codes and layouts made with different types of boards and sensors. At this stage, we used two boards (Arduino UNO and ReadBear BLE Micro) and two sensor breakouts (ADXL362 and MPU6050). The breakouts are depicted in JPEG files in this folder.
